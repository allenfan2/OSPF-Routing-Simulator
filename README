run ./router.sh <router_id> <nse_host> <nse_port> <router_port>

1.) Start NSE first with the router's host.
2.) Then begin to run router program from id = 1 to id = 5 in that order.

NOTE: During my testing I got these network delay errors that made my output errorness because somehow
packets were dropped. It  usually is caused by server lag.
If you get an incorrect result try running again. It happens about 10% of the time.
It might have to do with how the timeout of the receiving the packet. 


TESTED ON: UNDERGRAD 02,08,06, both same host for NSE/Routers and different host.
